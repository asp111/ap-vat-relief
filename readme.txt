VAT Relief or TAX Exempt Plugin for Woocommerce. Customer can apply for VAT relief at checkout from the eligible products to get it removed.

== Description ==
A simple and minimalist VAT relief plugin that removes the VAT or TAX from specific products at checkout. The plugin covers both scenarios of VAT Relief for:
- Person applying for VAT relief
- Charity applying for VAT relief

A product can be marked eligible for VAT relief in the backend, and on checkout, the customer can apply for VAT relief by filling required information to claim it and takeout VAT from the order total.

The VAT relief information of Person or Charity is stored and displayed nicely in order details page, order emails and order thankyou page.

Useful for below online shops:
- Medical and surgical appliances
- Wheelchairs and mobility scooters
- Equipment to aid the hard of hearing, and low vision aids
